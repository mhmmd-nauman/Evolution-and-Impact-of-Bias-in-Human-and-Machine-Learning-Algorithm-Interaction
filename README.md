All data used for this project


1. Synthetic data is generated by the PythonNotebook
2. The movie data is using the movielens data here:  http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html. (Note that this the latest one, we used previous version, since this study started before they made changes. Old version data is posted in the data folder)
